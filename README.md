# Paul Gebheim - Slackmagic / Magic Search

## What's this do?

This application will allow you to invite a bot to a channel, and that bot will index any messages sent into the channel and make them searchable. The cool part is this even works with images!

Any image uploaded to your channel will get OCR'd and indexed using Algolia search.

## Searching

Simply use the '/ms' command with some terms, results will be viewable inline.
